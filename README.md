# 🏴‍☠️ BlackP3arl V2 Theme for Obsidian

**BlackP3arl V2** (v1.1.0) is a high-contrast brutalist cyberpunk theme for Obsidian. It merges the imposing presence of the **Anton** font with advanced ergonomic features to turn your vault into a tactical interface.

## 📜 What's new in V2? (Ergonomic Overhaul)

The "V2" version improves navigation and structural clarity:

### 1. 📂 File Explorer Focus Mode
*   **Active Highlight**: The folder path leading to your active file is highlighted with a subtle neon border.
*   **Intelligent Dimming**: When hovering over the file explorer, inactive items dim to 50% to reduce visual noise and help you navigate faster.

### 2. 📑 Dynamic Depth Markers
*   Headers (H1-H6) now display technical level markers (e.g., `[LVL-01]`) on hover or in edit mode. Instantly validate your note structure without counting hashes.

### 3. 🛡️ Cyber-Brutalist Callouts
*   Admonitions (`> [!info]`) feature a military terminal aesthetic: asymmetrical clipped corners, no rounded edges, and "scanline" backgrounds for titles.

### 4. 📍 Hierarchical Bullet Points
*   Bulleted lists now inherit the Imperial Color System. A top-level bullet will be **Congo Pink**, a sub-bullet **Orange**, etc. Bullet shapes also change with depth for instant visual recognition.
